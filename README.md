Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is designed to process a data from a CSV file and allow users to query the data using a chatbot interface.

- How It Works

1️ Data Loading: The system reads and processes the CSV file using pandas.

2️ Vector Database Creation (FAISS): The text data is converted into embeddings and stored in a FAISS index for fast retrieval.

3️ Query Handling: When a user asks a question, the model retrieves relevant documents from FAISS.

4️ Response Generation (LLM): The retrieved information is passed to an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate a natural language answer.

5️ Chatbot UI (Streamlit): A user-friendly chatbot interface is built using Streamlit, allowing conversational interaction with the dataset.


- Technologies & Models Used
Below are the key technologies and models used in the implementation:


1️⃣ FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
 What is FAISS?

FAISS is an efficient vector database used for fast retrieval of similar text chunks.
It allows quick similarity searches in large datasets.
 Why is FAISS used here?

Instead of searching raw text in a CSV file, we convert text into vectors and store them in FAISS, making queries much faster.
 How FAISS works in this project?

Step 1: The CSV data is converted into text chunks.
Step 2: These chunks are embedded using a sentence transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Step 3: FAISS stores and retrieves the most relevant chunks based on similarity.

2️⃣ SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
 What is this model?

all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a sentence embedding model from Hugging Face.
It converts text into vector representations, which helps in similarity searches.
 Why are embeddings needed?

To compare text effectively, we need a numerical representation.
Example: If a user asks, "What is the body temperature of Patient 2?", we find similar text chunks instead of doing an exact word match.
 Why use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 instead of other models?

Faster and lightweight 
Good accuracy for sentence similarity 
Works well with FAISS 


3️⃣ LLM (Large Language Model) – Moondream
 What is an LLM?

An LLM is an AI model trained to generate human-like text.
It takes retrieved text and generates a meaningful answer.
 Why use moondream LLM?

It’s optimized for answering queries based on context.
It integrates well with FAISS and Streamlit.
 How does the LLM work here?

Retrieves relevant documents from FAISS.
Uses the retrieved context to generate a natural response.
Returns the final answer to the user.


4️⃣ Streamlit (For Chatbot UI)
 Why use Streamlit?

It’s a lightweight framework for building interactive web apps.
Perfect for AI and ML models that require a simple chatbot-like UI.
 What does Streamlit do in this project?

File Upload: Allows users to upload a CSV file.
Chat Interface: Displays user queries & responses.
Real-time Processing: Shows retrieved documents and their sources.


 - Overall Flow of the Model
 
1️⃣ User uploads a CSV file → The data is loaded.

2️⃣ FAISS creates a vector store → Data is split into chunks and embedded.

3️⃣ User enters a query → FAISS retrieves the most relevant text.

4️⃣ LLM generates an answer → The retrieved context is used to generate a response.

5️⃣ Chatbot displays the answer → The result is shown to the user.


- Why is This Model Powerful?
 Faster than traditional text searches (Uses FAISS for rapid retrieval).
 Generates human-like responses (Uses an LLM instead of keyword matching).
 Works on any dataset (CSV file can contain any structured data).
 User-friendly UI (Built using Streamlit for easy interaction).

This RAG-based chatbot allows fast and interactive querying of patient data, making it ideal for medical data analysis, business intelligence, or any structured document search.
